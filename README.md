# tworks_radio

This is the Android Application that was built to communicate via bluetooth 
and subsequently control the Arduino based Radio that was built as a part of 
the summer internship program of five BITS Pilani, Hyderabad students at T-Works. 

Feel free to contact me for instructions on how to build the device that would be able to communicate with the app.
